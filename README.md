# qm-with-code
Basic quantum mechanics problems in python. Currently in progress, but the eventual plan is to write some tutorials introducing these problems and numerical methods that you can use to compute them. 

## Highlight:
Nondimensionalized 1-D particle in a box simulation, with a Gaussian initial condition. Solved via Crank-Nicolson method
